The Library Management System is a console-based application built in C++ that aims to automate the management of a library's books and members. The system allows users to perform various operations such as adding new books and members, issuing and returning books, and searching for books and members. The project also includes fine calculation for overdue books and generates reports on issued books.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a seamless and efficient way to manage a library's resources, reducing manual effort and enhancing accuracy in record-keeping. The system's functionalities are designed to be intuitive, allowing users to perform tasks with ease through a series of menu-driven options.
